 How long did you spend on the coding test? 

          I spent approximately 8 hours on the coding test over the course of two days. This includes initial planning, development, testing, and documentation.

What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

           The useEffect hook in React is indeed a powerful and versatile feature that was added in previous versions of React. It allows developers to perform side effects in functional components.

Here's how useEffect is used in the provided code snippet:

   useEffect(() => {
        const storedTasks = localStorage.getItem('tasks');
        const parsedTasks = storedTasks ? JSON.parse(storedTasks) : [];
        setTasks(parsedTasks);
    }, []);



How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Tracking down performance issues in production requires a systematic approach:

      Monitoring: Use monitoring tools to identify performance bottlenecks, such as slow API requests or rendering times. Profiling tools, like Chrome DevTools Performance tab , can help pinpoint specific areas of the code causing performance issues.


       Code Review and Analysis: Review the codebase for potential performance pitfalls, such as inefficient algorithms, unnecessary re-renders, or excessive DOM manipulation. Optimize critical code paths and refactor where necessary.

       Caching and Optimization: Implement caching strategies to reduce unnecessary computations and optimize data fetching. Use performance optimization techniques like code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization to improve overall responsiveness.

Yes, I have experience tracking down performance issues in production environments. In one project, we encountered slow page load times due to inefficient database queries. By analyzing query execution plans and optimizing database indexes, we were able to significantly improve performance.


If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?

      Given more time, I would consider implementing the following additional features and improvements to enhance the task management application:

    User authentication and authorization: Implement user accounts and authentication to allow users to securely log in and manage their tasks.
    Task categories and labels: Allow users to categorize tasks with custom labels or tags for better organization and filtering.
    Reminders and notifications: Integrate with notification services to send reminders for upcoming tasks or overdue deadlines.
    Collaboration features: Enable users to share tasks with team members, assign responsibilities, and track task progress collaboratively.
    Accessibility improvements: Enhance accessibility features to ensure the application is usable for all users, including those with disabilities.
    Data visualization: Provide graphical representations of task data, such as charts or graphs, to visualize task priorities, completion rates, and trends.

These additional features and improvements would further enhance the functionality and usability of the task management application, providing users with a more comprehensive and efficient task management solution.
